# Window Modal with JavaScript

This project demonstrates how to create a window modal using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. A modal window is a pop-up element that appears on top of the main content to display alerts, dialogs, or additional content without navigating away from the current page.

## Features

- **Open Modal:** The modal can be triggered by a button click.
- **Close Modal:** The modal can be closed by clicking the "close" button, clicking outside the modal, or pressing the "Escape" key.
- **Responsive Design:** The modal adapts to different screen sizes for both desktop and mobile users.

## How It Works

- **HTML:** The modal is included in the HTML structure but hidden by default.
- **CSS:** Styles the modal for appearance and positioning, ensuring it is centered and the background is dimmed when active.
- **JavaScript:** Handles the logic for showing and hiding the modal, including event listeners for user interactions.
